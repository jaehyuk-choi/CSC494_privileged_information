# Leveraging LLMs to Generate Privileged Information for Clinical Predictive Tasks

This repository accompanies the research project **"Leveraging LLMs to Generate Privileged Information for Clinical Predictive Tasks"** by **David Pellow and Jaehyuk Choi**. The project explores how privileged information generated by large language models (LLMs) can enhance predictive modeling in healthcare by generating synthetic, context-rich auxiliary data used only during training.

## 📌 Overview

Predictive modeling in clinical settings is often limited by small, imbalanced datasets. Rather than using LLMs as direct predictors, this project investigates their utility in generating **privileged information** — synthetic features used exclusively at training time to guide the model.

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**  
   - LLMs (LLaMA-8B, LLaMA-70B) are prompted to simulate clinical reasoning and generate side information (e.g., HbA1c predictions, risk scores).

2. **Pattern-Based Integration**  
   LLM-generated data is integrated through four training paradigms:

   - **Direct**:  
     LLM-generated scalar features (e.g., predicted HbA1c) are directly appended to the input feature vector during training only.

   - **Multi-task**:  
     The model is jointly trained on the main task and auxiliary LLM-generated labels (e.g., `health_1_10`, `risk_score`, `has_diabetes`) with a shared encoder.

   - **Multi-view**:  
     Original and LLM-generated features are processed via separate encoders (view1/view2). Only view1 is available during testing.

   - **Pairwise Similarity**:  
     The LLM generates similarity scores between patient pairs to supervise models with pairwise inputs.

   - *Hybrid strategies* (e.g., Direct + Multi-task) are also implemented.

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   Multiple strategies are used:
   - Simultaneous training  
   - Decoupled training  
   - Pretraining followed by fine-tuning

  Predicts diabetes onset based on demographic and lifestyle features.

- **MIMIC-IV Dataset**  
  Predicts in-hospital mortality using ICU patient time-series data.
